# Iterated file renaming

This file allows you to rename files and iterate them automatically.
You can rename all your vacation photos for example:

abcd.png, 
efgh.jpeg, 
ijkl.heic

to

holiday_1.png, 
holiday_2.jpeg, 
holiday_3.heic


With this script, you won't have to rename your files manually.
All your files in a repository will get renamed. The filename extensions will remain the same.
